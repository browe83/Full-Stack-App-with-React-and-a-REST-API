### TechDegree Project 10  
Disclaimer: I completed this project as part of my Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree. CSS and HTML were provided.

## About
This project creates a full stack application with a React front-end and a RESTful Express API.  It provides a way for users to adminster a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing details for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.  The app requires users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.
