Disclaimer: I completed this project as part of my Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree. CSS and HTML were provided.

## About
This project creates a full stack application with a React front-end and a RESTful Express API.  It provides a way for users to adminster a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing details for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.  The app requires users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.

## Installation
After cloning repository, notice the two directories in the root folder: `api` and `client`.  For both, you will need to run `npm install`.  Then, for the `api`,
run `npm run seed` to create initial data.  Lastly, run `npm start` in separate terminals for both the `api` and `client` directories.
