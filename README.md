Hi!

Thanks for taking a look at my project. I look forward to your feedback.  To run the app after cloning, open the client and api directories in separate terminals.  Run npm install and then npm start for both.  Sign up for the Courses App on the sign up page to experience full functionality.  

Thanks agai!
Best,
Brandon
